## Mission Statement

Green roofs, sometimes referred to as “eco-roofs” consist of a system where waterproofing membrane, soil and vegetation overlay traditional roofing systems. Such a conversion can contribute immensely to lowering costs associated with storm water runoff, energy use, and material waste reduction. 

Environmental benefits also exist. Green roofs serve as a habitat for species of ground-nesting birds, improve air quality, decrease pollution from runoff, prevent weathering, improve soil moisture and evapotranspiration cycles, reduce greenhouse gasses, and mitigate urban heat islands on microclimates. 

Ultimately, greener cities are healthier cities – the overall quality of life among the population is only one of many externalities associated with having more green spaces in your city.

Urban dwellers across North America are fighting to include more green spaces into their cities, planners are incorporating green design into their projects, and property owners are continuously searching for ways to increase the property valuation of their buildings. Green rooftops are the one of the latest and greatest approaches to appease this multifaceted need. The Elevated Oasis Application works to provide its users with a way to plan and promote green roofs in their city. Whether it is a concerned citizen who wants a to know if a green roof can be installed on their building, a planning department who wants to know the availability of installations in a particular area of the city, or a property holder who wants to determine the cost of a green roof installation, or just an interested individual; Elevated Oasis is here to help.  


2. Statement of the characteristics of the app that make it appealing, interesting and useful (i.e., how does it help the end user);

Elevated oasis is designed to help the user calculate the cost of ownership, and savings associated with the installation or retrofit of a new Green Roof.

## Data Sources
* Vancouver Open Data Catalog
..*LiDAR 2013
..*Building footprints

## Limitations
During the building vectorization it was not possible to refine buildings into individual features, given the time constraints. As a result, the features derived from the .las files are in groups based on buildings that are within three meters of one another – according to the classified .las file. This effects the output of the rooftop area
