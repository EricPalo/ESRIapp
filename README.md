3D buildings
Shade at different times of day
roof max elevation
rooftop area
min. slope for a green roof



## Usage Instructions
### How to install this application
Download the ElevatedOasis.zip folder and decompress the files within the folder. These files include further application information and scripts to be browsed at the leisure of the user. The application can be launched through the index.html. This must be done within the Google Chrome or Firefox platform. 

### Select your Location
Browse through the 3D map of West-End Vancouver to find the location of your choosing. Click on the building for further information about whether this building is suitable for green roof development.

### Information Tab
Users can read through this tab in order to understand how to use the application. 

### Learn More Tab
Click this tab located on the main splash screen in order to read about the benefits, incentives, and lifespan of green roofs. Click the links for further information and details on who you can contact.

### Further Contacts Tab
Also located on the main splash screen, this tab provides information on local businesses that provide green roof consulting and installation.

### Shade Analysis
Click through drop-down menu, located on the bottom right of the screen and choose a desired time of day to analyze. This allows the user to visually determine the amount of shade effecting each rooftop at different times in the day based on surrounding buildings.

## Limitations
During the building vectorization it was not possible to refine buildings into individual features, given the time constraints. As a result, the features derived from the .las files are in groups based on buildings that are within three meters of one another â€“ according to the classified .las file. This effects the output of the rooftop area. 

This application is limited to use in Google Chrome and Firefox.

## Future Improvments
* Spending a greater amount of time refining building vectorization
* Increase size of study area
